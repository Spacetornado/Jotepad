## Features

GUI checklist that opens when you press F4 (keybind is configurable).

Add custom items to the list. Click an "X" button to remove an item from the list.

Click Clear List to delete the entire list.

Click Close to hide the list, or press F4 again.


## Changelog

0.7.7 - Fixed issue where you can activate your boss power when adding a new item (thanks Wombat for pointing this out).

0.7.6 - Keybind is F4 by default now (otherwise typing J in the input field dismisses Jotepad).

0.7.4 - Keybind is configurable (and now J by default instead of Insert), can delete individual items, GUI improvements, more error checking.

0.6.1 - Initial release.
